A Flask app for inserting text and image templates using a shortcut

This repo is in progress and not yet open to contributions. I am attempting to remake a two year old project 
[Text-Script](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/text-script) which got 74 stars. This was a pretty big deal to me as a
learning programmer, but the app could have been much better. I wanted to give it another shot after spending
the past few years learning Flask.
